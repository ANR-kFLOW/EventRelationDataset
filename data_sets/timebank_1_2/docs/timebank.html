<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The TimeBank Corpus contains 183 news articles that have been
annotated with temporal information, adding events, times and temporal
links between events and times. The annotation follows the TimeML
1.2.1 specification. This file includes a brief discussion of TimeML
as well as a description of how TimeBank was created.</p>

<p>The most recent information on TimeML is always available
at <a href="http://www.timeml.org">www.timeml.org.</a></p>

<h2>Overview of TimeML</h2>

<p>TimeML aims to capture and represent temporal information.  This is
accomplished using four primary tag types: TIMEX3 for temporal
expressions, EVENT for temporal events, SIGNAL for temporal signals,
and LINK for representing relationships.  For a detailed description
of TimeML, see the TimeML 1.2.1 <a
href="timeml_specs_1.2.1.html">Specification</a> and <a
href="timeml_annguide_1.2.1.pdf">Guidelines</a>.  Here, we give a
summary of each tag.</p>

<p><b>TIMEX3</b> &#8212; This tag is used to capture dates, times,
durations, and sets of dates and times.  All TIMEX3 tags include a
type and a value along with some other possible attributes. The value
is given according to the ISO 8601 standard. The TIMEX3 tag allows
specification of a tempral anchor. This facilitates the use of
temporal functions to calculate the value of an underspecified
temporal expression.  For example, an article might include a document
creation time such as "January 3, 2006".  Later in the article, the
temporal expression "today" may occur.  By anchoring the TIMEX3 for
"today" to the document creation time, we can determine the exact
value of the TIMEX3.</p>

<p><b>EVENT</b> &#8212; The EVENT tag is used to annotate those
elements in a text that mark the semantic events described by it. Any
event that can be temporally anchored or ordered is captured with this
tag.  An EVENT includes a class attribute with values such
as <val>occurrence</val>, <val>state</val>, or <val>reporting</val>.
The class of an EVENT may indicate what relationships the event
participates in.  In addition to the EVENT tag, events are also
annotated with one or more MAKEINSTANCE tags that include information
about a particular instance of the event. This includes part of
speech, tense, aspect, modality, and polarity. When an event
participates in a relationship, it is actually the event instance that
is referenced.  This is to allow for statements such as "John taught
on Monday but not on Tuesday."  Here, there are actually two instances
of the teaching-event: one that has a positive polarity and one that
is negative.  Further, each instance participates in its own temporal
relationship with respect to "Monday" and "Tuesday".<p>

<p><b>SIGNAL</b> &#8212; The SIGNAL tag is used to annotate temporal
function words such as "after", "during", and "when".  These signals
are then used in the representation of a temporal relationship.</p>

<p>The following three tags are link tags. They capture temporal,
subordination, and aspectual relationships found in the text. These
tags do not consume any actual text, but they do relate the three
tag types above to each other.</p>

<p><b>TLINK</b> &#8212; Temporal links are represented with a TLINK
tag.  A TLINK can temporally relate two temporal expressions, two
event instances, or a temporal expression and an event instance.
Along with an identification marker for each of these two elements, a
relation type is given such as <val>before</val>, <val>includes</val>,
or <val>ended_by</val>.  When a signal is present that helps to define
the relationship, an ID for the SIGNAL is given as well.</p>

<p><b>SLINK</b> &#8212; This tag is used to capture subordination
relationships that involve event modality, evidentiality, and
factuality.  An SLINK includes an event instance ID for the
subordinating event and an event instance ID for the subordinated
event.  Possible relation types for SLINK
include <val>modal</val>, <val>evidential</val>,
and <val>factive</val>.  An SLINK will typically not include a signal
ID unless it has the relation type conditional.  Three specific EVENT
classes interact with SLINK:
<val>reporting</val>, <val>i_state</val>, and <val>i_action</val>.</p>

<p><b>ALINK</b> &#8212; An aspectual connection between two event
instances is represented with ALINK.  As with SLINK, this tag includes
two event instance IDs, one that introduces the ALINK and one that is
the event argument to that event. The introducing event has the
class <val>aspectual</val>. Some possible relation types for ALINK are
<val>initiates</val>, <val>terminates</val>,
and <val>continues</val>.</p>

<h2>TimeBank Statistics</h2>

TimeBank 1.2 contains 183 articles with just over 61,000
non-punctuation tokens. The count for each TimeML tag is listed below:

<h2>TimeBank Sources</h2>

<p>The TimeBank sources come from a variety of news
reports.  Specifically, articles come from the Automatic Content
Extraction (ACE) program and PropBank (TreeBank2) texts.  Those coming
from ACE come from transcribed broadcast news from the following
sources: ABC, CNN, PRI, and VOA, and newswire from AP and NYT.
PropBank supplied articles from the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>These particular sources were chosen because they offered text rich
with temporal information both in the form of temporal expressions and
events that could be anchored or ordered in time.</p>


<p><a name="anno"></a></p>
<h2>Annotation Effort</h2>

<p>The annotation of TimeBank has been a multi-step process.  In the
first phase, five annotators with varying backgrounds in linguistics
took part.  In addition to their annotation work, each participated in
the development of the TimeML annotation scheme.  This phase of the
annotation took place during several annotation-intensive
weeks. Throughout this time, the annotators met to discuss their work
so that they could achieve a high level of annotator agreement.</p>

<p>The annotation of each document during this phase of the effort
began with a preprocessing step.  This involved the tagging of some
events and signals.  When possible, preprocessing also attempted to
supply the class, tense, and aspect of the tagged events.  After
preprocessing, one of the five annotators completed the annotation of
the document including a check of the output from the preprocessing
step.</p>

<p>During this phase of the annotation effort, TimeML was still under
development.  Subsequent phases of annotation involved updating this
early version of TimeBank to the current TimeML specification, version
1.2.1.  This has been done automatically where possible and manually
where needed.</p>

<p>The most recent phase of the TimeBank development involved four
annotators who have all previously participated in some TimeML
annotation and are intimately familiar with the latest specification.
Each annotator focused on a specific set of TimeML tags and used the

<a href="http://www.timeml.org/site/timebank/browser.html"
target="_blank">TimeBank browser</a>

to check whether the annotation of his or her tags is accurate and
complete.  This current release of TimeBank reflects this work.<p>

<h2>Validation</h2>

TimeBank 1.2 has been validated against version 1.2.1 of the Document
Type Definition and XML Schema. Validity checking against the DTD was
performed using the Perl XML::Checker::Parser module, available as
part of XML-Checker-0.13 from 

<a href="http://www.cpan.org/" target="_blank">www.cpan.org</a>. 

The XML schema were applied using the Xerces Java Parser, version 1.4.4,
available at

<a href="http://xerces.apache.org/" target="_blank">xerces.apache.org</a>.

Please refer to the readme file in the validation directory for more
information.

<h2>Future Work</h2>

Timebank is a new resource that is under constant revision. In the
near future, we will explore the following issues:

<ul>
<li>Multi-word events
<li>Event classes of slink introducing predicates
<li>Argument linking
<li>Generic events
<li>Inconsistencies in annotations of numbers and cardinals
<li>Temporal relations between document creation time and reporting events
<li>Distinction between creation time and publication time.
</ul>

Please contact us at timebank@timeml.org if you have any remarks on
the state or quality of TimeBank.
