['After a severe earthquake centered in Pakistan\'s Kashmir province killed more than 70,000 people in 2005, teams from a nonprofit architecture group based in London, England, helped the region start to rebuild.The group, Article 25, worked with local craftspeople to develop a design that could withstand earthquakes and trained them to build the structures.That experience may provide some lessons for the rebuilding of Haiti, where Article 25 is also planning to help with reconstruction, according to Robin Cross, an architect who is the organization\'s director of projects.As in Haiti, at least some of the death and injury in Pakistan stemmed from local building methods." The important point is that it is n\'t generally earthquakes that kill people, " Cross said." It\'s generally buildings that kill people.Building design is a way to solve that problem. "In Pakistan, Article 25 worked with local craftspeople to determine the best way to build structures that could withstand quakes and then helped train people to build them." By the time we built 80 to 100 buildings and we pulled out, we were leaving not just buildings, but also a capacity to build, " Cross said." Each building we built there was the site of a training exercise for a team of workers -- concrete workers, carpenters, roofers, plasterers, " said Cross." They have obviously been able to take these skills away.In the long run the idea was that we would do ourselves out of a job. "Cross spoke to CNN on January 29.CNN : What is the role of architects in planning the rebuilding of Haiti, based on your experience in Pakistan ?Robin Cross : At this point, the focus is rightly on relief, and the provision of water, food and medical care, the basic life support system....What we wo n\'t be doing is clogging up that quite strained delivery system with the bricks and mortar of longer-term reconstruction.But there is going to come a point very shortly when minds need to turn to longer-term construction planning, and that\'s where architects and engineers have a role to play.Our work in Pakistan began quite soon after the earthquake.But the important factor is that it\'s still ongoing, that we need to be there for the long run....What we were doing there was working with local NGOs [ non-governmental organizations ], particularly with Muslim Aid, to identify the most vulnerable members of the community who could most benefit from our architectural and design skills, and could n\'t afford to buy in their own construction expertise, and would be most marginalized and vulnerable in the future.So we worked with Muslim Aid to develop a series of earthquake-resistant buildings which could then be delivered on a range of different sites.We put people in the field to provide quality assurance, to make sure that the buildings that were built would be earthquake-resistant.After a disaster there\'s an enormous demand for reconstruction, a demand for materials, designers, particularly builders -- so they will tend to be drawn very rapidly into high-value commercial work, which could leave less financially strong people without access to building skills.That could lead to them building in a poor and unsafe way, so you get into a very dangerous cycle of vulnerability.By building the capacity of local work teams to build, you enable people to build for themselves and break that cycle of vulnerability.CNN : What kind of buildings did you build ?Cross : We were intent on providing an earthquake-resistant home design....The buildings are a lightweight frame construction, which means they are able to flex in the event of an earthquake.We adopted the dhaji dewari technique, an indigenous technique developed out of the materials in that landscape.We adapted it and improved its details to make it more earthquake-resistant....CNN : How much do these houses cost ?Cross : Approximately &#163; 4,000 [ about $6,300 at current rates ] per house.That compares very well with the equivalent house in concrete block, which would normally be used.It is n\'t just safer than a concrete-block equivalent but it\'s also more economical and it\'s quicker to deliver.CNN : What\'s it made of ?Cross : It\'s made of lightweight timber frame with many cross-facing elements, and the gaps between cross-facing elements are infilled with stones and mud and then rendered over with mud.What that generates is a design which flexes when the earthquake strikes, the energy of the earthquake is dissipated through the many framing elements of the building, and the energy is lost in the friction between the timber and the stone infill....A concrete-block building which is n\'t able to flex is more apt to collapse....The other thing that\'s worth mentioning is that the buildings have a lightweight roof.In the worst eventuality, if the roof collapses, if it\'s lightweight, it\'s much less likely to kill people....CNN : What similarities are there between the building styles in Pakistan and Haiti ?Cross : I have n\'t yet been to Haiti, and we\'ll be undertaking our first visit as soon as conditions really allow that to happen, which I think will be in February or early March.But what I think we will find is that there will be an equivalent vernacular tradition in Haiti from which we can learn a lot.I\'m sure the problem that we saw in Pakistan is shared in Haiti -- in that concrete buildings have been built poorly, without adequate technical supervision, and have proved very vulnerable to the earthquake.A good architect will never decide at a distance what the right technical approach would be, because it\'s always important to understand the location....So when we go to Haiti, the first thing we will do will be to carry out participation workshops with the local communities, to carry out a needs assessment but also a skills assessment... so we design the right buildings, appropriate to the materials available and the skills that are present.CNN : It\'s still early, but how do you assess the need in Haiti compared to the need in Pakistan ?Cross : All of the information we have at the moment suggests that the need is even greater in Haiti.In Pakistan, the earthquake did enormous damage, but there was still a strong national government, relatively strong local government and a strong military presence in the Pakistan army with which we could collaborate.In Haiti those institutions were already weak and in many cases have been destroyed by the earthquake.The partnerships which we would look to build with local governments may be much harder....There\'s likely to be an even greater role for strong strategic planning and long-term thinking from architects....I should say that you should never see Haiti as a blank slate.You look at the images, you think the damage is so great, it\'s a clean sweep -- but you should never see it as a blank canvas on which to impose a master plan from London or North America.There remains in Haiti a social infrastructure, an economic infrastructure, even in the slum areas there\'s an economically vibrant infrastructure.It\'s those threads of the community infrastructure that we need to find and build a new Haiti around.So all of our work starts with community participation and is part of empowering the local community and making sure that what we design is compatible with their objectives....One of the big problems immediately after this kind of disaster is the lack of long-term investment.The funding for short-term relief is good and is needed, but very often at the point of about a year, that funding just falls off a cliff.That\'s what I\'m hoping will be improved on in the Haiti response.', 'empower', '2010.02.03.cross.quake.resistant.housing.tml']

['Even before her 18th birthday, Maria had already been enslaved by a gang of human traffickers and held in captivity for four months in her homeland of Mexico.While a prisoner, Maria witnessed a sickening trade in human life and recalls how young girls were drugged, forced into prostitution and then murdered.What makes Maria\'s story so special is that she was one of the lucky ones who were able to escape.Maria, whose real name we are n\'t using, used to live in the border town of Ciudad Juarez.The city is home to two drug cartels that fight a bloody turf war for lucrative smuggling routes to America.In a four-day period, 41 people were murdered, while over the past decade, 450 women were killed and 3,000 went missing." Today girls are still going missing but their bodies are never found, " Miguel Perea, a local journalist told Britain\'s Channel 4." There\'s no trace of them and their mothers and families of these girls -- they have n\'t got a clue what\'s happened to them. "Maria described how at the age of 16 she was lured off the streets by a young man who promised the world, but delivered nothing but pain.She was raped, drugged and sold for sex." They took a gallon of gasoline and started pouring it over a girl, " Maria said." One of the men told me if you do n\'t do as I say I will do the same to you." I wanted to look away, but they did n\'t let me.Even though the girl was on fire they kept hitting her and they were laughing as if they were enjoying what they were doing. "Maria described a cross-border trade in young children and babies -- with orders coming in regularly from the U.S." They stole the children and one of the gang members took a six-year-old kid that I had to look after for three hours." He told me he wanted to see his mummy then I started crying and said\'I do n\'t think you\'re ever going to see your mummy again.\' "The claims that Maria made were so serious that she was asked by the Department of Homeland Security to come to the U.S. to tell her story.Mexican authorities accompanied Maria on her trip to Houston to work alongside U.S. authorities on the case.The U.S. State Department estimates that more than 20,000 people are trafficked into the U.S. each year -- mainly destined for the sex trade.Authorities have launched an immediate investigation into Maria\'s story." I want to tell the story so that in the near future, other girls do n\'t go through the same, " Maria said." Women are sold, they are abducted, bought and even killed by these men." If these men are ever found, jail wo n\'t be enough to make them pay for the way they\'ve made us feel. "', 'let', '2010.01.13.mexico.human.traffic.drug.tml']

Beige, " " sexy black and gold, " " crimson red, " " turquoise, " " nude with a lot of padding, " read some.The color scheme has left male users scratching their heads and asking " Huh ? "So, what is behind the trend ?It\'s all part of an effort to raise awareness for breast cancer by asking women to post the color of the bra they\'re wearing.Female Facebookers started catching on this week as a message made its rounds through the inboxes of the social media network." We are playing a game for Breast Cancer Awareness, " one form of the message read." Write the color of your bra as your status -- just the color, nothing else !!Copy this and pass it on to all girls -- NO MEN !!This will be fun to see how it spreads. "By Friday, all the colors of the Victoria\'s Secret rainbow were present in users\' news feeds when they logged in.A spokeswoman for Facebook said it\'s not clear where or how the message started, calling it an example of a grass-roots movement beginning on the social networking site." What is particularly unique about this grass-roots campaign is that it seems to have been started by a user or group of users, as opposed to an official entity, and spread virally throughout Facebook, " Facebook\'s Malorie Lucich said." It\'s an ideal example of how an individual voice can be magnified to create awareness for a good cause and ignite action among millions by using a site like Facebook. "Breast cancer groups say they are happy that the disease, which affects more than 200,000 women in the United States a year, is getting attention." It\'s not one of our campaigns, but we\'re all for it, " said Andrea Rader, a spokeswoman for Susan G. Komen for the Cure." Just about anything that raises this issue in a positive, fun way is just terrific. "Lucich said hundreds, if not thousands, of users were posting their color choices directly to the Susan G. Komen and Breast Cancer Awareness Facebook pages.Rader encouraged women to take the trend one step further by visiting the Komen Web site and getting more information about ways to raise awareness.Meanwhile, some tech blogs were calling the color string the new " 25 Things, " a meme -- Internet speak for a concept or catchphrase that spreads quickly on the Web -- that went viral in early 2009.Users were asked to post notes with random tidbits about themselves and then " tag " other users to do the same.The " 25 Things " note was virtually unavoidable for a three-week period as users passed it on, sort of like a modern-day chain letter.It\'s unclear whether the color meme will have the same popularity if half of Facebook\'s 350 million active users ca n\'t participate.', 'let', '2010.01.08.facebook.bra.color.tml']
['President Obama recently encouraged Americans to " take about 10 minutes to answer 10 questions " and fill out their 2010 census form.This year\'s questionnaire is one of the shortest in history, but the results of the survey have long-term effects.The census, taken every 10 years, is used to determine how to allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds and seats House of Representatives and determine the boundaries of representatives\' districts." There is no representative democracy without it.It\'s the scientific, nonpartisan, apolitical starting point of what eventually becomes a quite partisan, political process, " said Kenneth Prewitt, a professor at Columbia\'s School of International and Public Affairs and the former director of the United States Census Bureau.The House is made up of 435 congressional seats that represent relatively equal slices of the population.When data from the census show a shift in population, seats in the House get reassigned.Some states might pick up a seat or two, while others are forced to combine two districts into one.The process of apportioning seats is straightforward, but redistricting is much more complicated.Districts are supposed to be redrawn to reflect population changes and to make sure there is equal representation in the House.State legislators and governors typically draw the districts, but some states rely on restricting committees.Districts can affect the balance of power in the House and representation in the state legislature." People try to do things that are to their political advantage if they happen to be in power because maybe the next time the census comes out, the other party will be in power, " said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.Lawmakers have been accused of carving district lines around the constituents that will give their party an advantage and secure political gains.The process is known as gerrymandering, a term coined after Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry.Elected in 1810, he signed an obscure redistricting bill that enabled greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature.Related : Who was Elbridge Gerry ?Critics say gerrymandering gives those in power an unfair advantage and can dilute the power of minority groups.The Supreme Court in 2006 took up a case looking at a redistricting plan promoted by then-U.S.House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas.After the 2000 census, a state court redrew the Texas map with input from state lawmakers.But after Republicans gained control of the legislature in 2002, DeLay promoted a second redistricting proposal for congressional boundaries.The Texas legislature adopted the plan in 2003 after three contentious special sessions called by Republican Gov. Rick Perry.The legislative plan led to the 2004 ouster of four Democratic incumbents from Congress and sparked a bitter partisan battle.The court ruled that the redistricting plan unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts and tossed out a portion of the congressional map, but found the overall redistricting plan engineered by state Republicans acceptable.Prewitt said the redrawing of lines to the benefit of one party or the neglect of other is just a part of the political process." The production of the statistics has got to be nonpolitical... but the use of the statistics can be as political as the country wants it to be, " he said." I expect people to try to take advantage of situations to advance their political goals, interests, values -- so it\'s healthy.Now, do I think overtime creating districts so incumbents are always re-elected is the healthiest way to have a democracy ?No, " Prewitt said, adding that it\'s up to the voters to decide whether they want to throw someone out of office.The more pressing issue for Prewitt is making sure everyone is counted because he said those who are n\'t counted will be treated unfairly in the political process and in the allocation of economic benefits.With more than 300 million people in the United States, it can be difficult to make sure than everyone is counted.Frey said calculating the homeless population and the population of those who do not speak English can be particularly challenging.Illegal immigrants, for example, sometimes opt not to turn in census forms for fear of legal ramifications.Those fears, however, are unwarranted because the information is confidential." The challenge that they have is a cost challenge, " said Frey.The Census Bureau has to follow up with those who do n\'t send in their forms with additional forms, telephone calls and even in-person visits -- and that adds up, he said.This year\'s census is projected to cost more than $14 billion.Prewitt said it\'s comparatively easy to count the first 75 to 85 percent, but the last 2 to 3 percent is " really, really tough going. "As the census gets underway, Prewitt said trying to count everyone, as mandated by the Constitution, should be the top concern." I\'m much more concerned about trying to have a fair census than I am about some drawing of odd lines after the census is over, " he said.CNN\'s David Ariosto and Bill Mears contributed to this report.', 'enable', '2010.02.26.census.redistricting.tml']
['President Obama extended a bipartisan olive branch to GOP leaders in the health care debate Tuesday, stating in a letter that he is willing to consider several of their ideas in a compromise plan.Specifically, the president said he may be willing to : &#8226; Commit $50 million to fund state initiatives designed to reduce medical malpractice costs &#8226; Allow undercover investigations of health care providers receiving Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs &#8226; Boost Medicaid reimbursements to doctors in certain states &#8226; Include language in the final bill ensuring certain high-deductible health plans can be offered in the health exchange The president said his decision to consider the GOP ideas was a result of last week\'s health care summit." The meeting was a good opportunity to move past the usual rhetoric and sound bites that have come to characterize this debate and identify areas on which we agree and disagree, " he wrote." I left convinced that the Republican and Democratic approaches to health care have more in common than most people think. "GOP leaders were unsatisfied with Obama\'s concessions.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said the president\'s ideas were little more than a few items " inadequately addressed in a 2,700-page bill. "McConnell repeated GOP calls for Congress to re-start deliberations from scratch." If the majority manages to jam this [ bill ] through... it will be the issue in every single race in America this fall, " he promised.Obama is set to lay out a political road map for passage of sweeping health care legislation on Wednesday, according to White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.Among other things, Obama is expected to advocate for an " up or down vote " in Congress if necessary, Gibbs said Monday.Multiple Democratic sources have said the emerging consensus plan is for the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill and send it to Obama.A package of changes that mirror the president\'s plan would then be passed through both chambers under reconciliation rules, which require only 51 votes in the Senate.Democrats lost their 60-vote, filibuster-proof Senate majority in January, when GOP Sen. Scott Brown won the Massachusetts Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat.Observers note, however, that it remains unclear exactly which health care provisions can be approved under reconciliation, which is reserved for legislation pertaining to the budget.Republicans have angrily criticized the Democrats\' potential use of reconciliation, arguing that the maneuver was never intended to be used for major policy overhauls along the lines of the health care bill.Democrats should " think twice " about using reconciliation, New Hampshire GOP Sen. Judd Gregg warned Tuesday.Obama\'s midweek remarks will also deal with the substance of health care reform, Gibbs said.White House aides said the president\'s speech will largely mirror the nearly $1 trillion compromise package he laid out one week ago.It may, however, be scaled back in some aspects, they said.CNN\'s Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report.', 'let', '2010.03.02.health.care.tml']
['Conservationists have welcomed the decision to reject a bid from Tanzania and Zambia to temporarily suspend a worldwide ban on trading in African elephant ivory so they can offload legal stockpiles in a one-off sale.The 175-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ), meeting in Doha, Qatar, on Monday, voted to reject the proposal amid concerns about elephant poaching.A petition from the two African countries to remove elephants from a list of animals " threatened with extinction " to allow trade in other parts of the animal was also thrown out." Poaching and illegal ivory markets in central and western Africa must be effectively suppressed before any further ivory sales take place, " said Elisabeth McLellan, of the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF )." It\'s welcome news, but my anxieties remain about the increased levels of poaching in Africa, " Save the Elephant\'s Dr. Ian Douglas-Hamilton told CNN.He said burgeoning ivory markets in countries such as China and Japan would be key battlegrounds in the fight against the illegal trade in future." There are huge problems ahead for the elephants, " he said." I do see this huge demand which is emanating mainly from the prosperity of China.We have to win their hearts and minds for conservation and for the elephant so that they have more of an idea of sustainable use and not over-taxing populations. "CITES banned the international commercial ivory trade in 1989 after elephant populations dropped dramatically across the world due to widespread poaching.But in 1997 and 2002 it permitted Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to sell limited stocks of ivory to Japan, in recognition of the fact that some southern African elephant populations were healthy and well managed.Five years later at a CITES meeting at The Hague further sales of stockpiled ivory were permitted in return for a nine-year moratorium on further sales.Both Zambia and Tanzania claimed elephant numbers in their territories were on the rise after years of decline.They also said the proceeds from the sale of government stockpiles would be put back into conservation and enforcement projects.Tanzania had asked to sell almost 90,000 kilograms of ivory that would have generated as much as $20 million, according to the CITES Web site, while Zambia looked to offload more than 21,000 kilograms.But wildlife experts in Kenya, part of a coalition of 23 African elephant range countries calling for an outright ban, say poaching has increased since the announcement of the last sale.Kenya orphanage takes elephant babies They argued the illegal trade in ivory has been turned into a lucrative business since poachers can launder their illegal ivory with the legal stockpiles." Though Zambia\'s anti-poaching enforcement measures are better than those of Tanzania, there is no justification for downgrading the elephants from the endangered list, " said Douglas-Hamilton, an expert on Kenya\'s elephant population." Tanzania has increased poaching and increased illegal markets.Their main elephant population has decreased by some 30,000 in the last three years." In Zambia there were huge declines in the elephant population in the 1970s and 1980s.Whereas other elephant populations across Africa have recovered slightly since the introduction of the ivory trade ban, Zambia\'s never have.They remain the same." In the mid-1970s the population was something like 160,000.It is currently estimated to sit at around 26,000. "He added that the situation was particularly desperate in central Africa where there are estimated to be just 20,000 elephants left from a population numbering 1 million 30 years ago.Last week, CITES members voted against adding Atlantic bluefin tuna to a list of banned exports.The popular sushi staple has been the focus of international attention as East Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the fish have decreased by an estimated nearly 61 percent in the last decade, according to International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( ICCAT ).CNN\'s David McKenzie contributed to this report.', 'permit', '2010.03.22.africa.elephants.ivory.trade.tml']

['Rather than getting their hands dirty in the cutthroat job market, savvy executives get the job offers to come to them.Executive search firms are hired by companies to find the best personnel to fill a vacancy.But you wo n\'t find these jobs advertised in newspapers or on Internet job boards.The only way to take advantage of this hidden job market is to get noticed by the executive recruiters.With the economy picking up it\'s time to get on the headhunters\' radar.Three industry experts tell us how Success breeds success The one thing you absolutely have to do to get a headhunter\'s attention is be good at your job.Kit Bingham, principal at executive search firm Odgers Berndtson, told CNN, " What gets noticed is success, so the way to get noticed [ by search firms ] is to be very good at your job." In time that gets noticed within your organization, and when it gets noticed within an organization, it tends to get noticed outside. "Why being a CEO " should carry a health warning " Speak up There are a number of ways to raise your profile outside your organization.Industry events are a good place to get your name known and make your voice heard." Most sectors have industry associations that hold conferences, " said Felix." Put yourself forward to speak at events and be on panels. "Get your name into print " Being quoted in the media is something the executive search firms will pick up on and take notice of, " said Ispahani.He suggested writing an article or think piece for publication.Trade publications are a good place to start and Ispahani said letting your company\'s PR or marketing department know you are interested in contributing to industry journals can help get things moving." If you really believe a business issue is interesting, writing a letter to an editor of a newspaper and getting it published is a way of raising your profile.It\'s useful to be seen as someone with a considered opinion, " said Ispahani.Show you\'re an expert -- write a book Build your network The more people know your name, the more chance a headhunter will get to hear about you.But networking is n\'t about getting to know as many people as possible, it\'s about getting to know the right people.Peter Felix, president of the Association of Executive Search Consultants, told CNN." Networking is a research-based activity.It\'s not just a matter of randomly talking to a few people you know -- it\'s a proactive process.You need to be well organized and build momentum." It\'s very time consuming and if you are employed you have to do it subtly and find the time to do it. "Seminars and conferences are good places to make new contacts, but do n\'t forget to develop a network within your own company.There is also a wealth of ways to network online ; just be aware that not all of them will be appropriate for you." Online networks like LinkedIn, which is for professionals, are a good way of sharing your network, joining other people\'s, and raising your visibility, " said Iraj Ispahani, of executive search firm Korn / Ferry Whitehead Mann." But there are other sorts of social networking that do n\'t fall into the professional category.There should be judicious use of networking -- not all networking is good networking, " he told CNN.Find a champion Having friends in high places who can vouch for your professional ability can help establish your credibility." A useful thing to do is to have a champion.That could be a senior mentor in the company, or someone who you\'ve worked with that recruitment companies may already know, " said Bingham." Having that person as a trusted third party endorsement can help enormously. "Working with a mentor Reach out to the recruiters Executive search firms have extensive databases of potential candidates and if you want the recruiters to know you exist you need to be in their records.But do n\'t just set about sending your resume to every search firm you can find." Identifying consultants who are relevant to your industry and career is an important part of career research, " said Felix.A Web search will help find the firms that fit your needs.Once you\'ve found the right firms to contact, Ispahani suggested emailing an introduction and following up with a phone call.If you\'ve written an article or achieved something you think they should be aware of, let them know and ask them to make a note of it on their database.Do n\'t wait until you\'re looking for a new job " It\'s important that executives should start to build relationships with executive search firms not just when they\'re looking for a job, " said Ispahani." They need to build those relationships and keep in touch with the researchers and partners at the search firm as their career is developing. "If you get a call from a search firm wanting to know your opinion of a former colleague, use it as an opportunity to connect with the headhunter." If someone calls you from an executive search firm to ask your perspective on someone you\'ve worked with in the past, be helpful, return the phone call." Those things are appreciated and remembered.If you\'re perceived to have been helpful, people will try to help you. "', 'let', '2010.03.23.how.get.headhunted.tml']
