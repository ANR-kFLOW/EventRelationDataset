['After a severe earthquake centered in Pakistan\'s Kashmir province killed more than 70,000 people in 2005, teams from a nonprofit architecture group based in London, England, helped the region start to rebuild.The group, Article 25, worked with local craftspeople to develop a design that could withstand earthquakes and trained them to build the structures.That experience may provide some lessons for the rebuilding of Haiti, where Article 25 is also planning to help with reconstruction, according to Robin Cross, an architect who is the organization\'s director of projects.As in Haiti, at least some of the death and injury in Pakistan stemmed from local building methods." The important point is that it is n\'t generally earthquakes that kill people, " Cross said." It\'s generally buildings that kill people.Building design is a way to solve that problem. "In Pakistan, Article 25 worked with local craftspeople to determine the best way to build structures that could withstand quakes and then helped train people to build them." By the time we built 80 to 100 buildings and we pulled out, we were leaving not just buildings, but also a capacity to build, " Cross said." Each building we built there was the site of a training exercise for a team of workers -- concrete workers, carpenters, roofers, plasterers, " said Cross." They have obviously been able to take these skills away.In the long run the idea was that we would do ourselves out of a job. "Cross spoke to CNN on January 29.CNN : What is the role of architects in planning the rebuilding of Haiti, based on your experience in Pakistan ?Robin Cross : At this point, the focus is rightly on relief, and the provision of water, food and medical care, the basic life support system....What we wo n\'t be doing is clogging up that quite strained delivery system with the bricks and mortar of longer-term reconstruction.But there is going to come a point very shortly when minds need to turn to longer-term construction planning, and that\'s where architects and engineers have a role to play.Our work in Pakistan began quite soon after the earthquake.But the important factor is that it\'s still ongoing, that we need to be there for the long run....What we were doing there was working with local NGOs [ non-governmental organizations ], particularly with Muslim Aid, to identify the most vulnerable members of the community who could most benefit from our architectural and design skills, and could n\'t afford to buy in their own construction expertise, and would be most marginalized and vulnerable in the future.So we worked with Muslim Aid to develop a series of earthquake-resistant buildings which could then be delivered on a range of different sites.We put people in the field to provide quality assurance, to make sure that the buildings that were built would be earthquake-resistant.After a disaster there\'s an enormous demand for reconstruction, a demand for materials, designers, particularly builders -- so they will tend to be drawn very rapidly into high-value commercial work, which could leave less financially strong people without access to building skills.That could lead to them building in a poor and unsafe way, so you get into a very dangerous cycle of vulnerability.By building the capacity of local work teams to build, you enable people to build for themselves and break that cycle of vulnerability.CNN : What kind of buildings did you build ?Cross : We were intent on providing an earthquake-resistant home design....The buildings are a lightweight frame construction, which means they are able to flex in the event of an earthquake.We adopted the dhaji dewari technique, an indigenous technique developed out of the materials in that landscape.We adapted it and improved its details to make it more earthquake-resistant....CNN : How much do these houses cost ?Cross : Approximately &#163; 4,000 [ about $6,300 at current rates ] per house.That compares very well with the equivalent house in concrete block, which would normally be used.It is n\'t just safer than a concrete-block equivalent but it\'s also more economical and it\'s quicker to deliver.CNN : What\'s it made of ?Cross : It\'s made of lightweight timber frame with many cross-facing elements, and the gaps between cross-facing elements are infilled with stones and mud and then rendered over with mud.What that generates is a design which flexes when the earthquake strikes, the energy of the earthquake is dissipated through the many framing elements of the building, and the energy is lost in the friction between the timber and the stone infill....A concrete-block building which is n\'t able to flex is more apt to collapse....The other thing that\'s worth mentioning is that the buildings have a lightweight roof.In the worst eventuality, if the roof collapses, if it\'s lightweight, it\'s much less likely to kill people....CNN : What similarities are there between the building styles in Pakistan and Haiti ?Cross : I have n\'t yet been to Haiti, and we\'ll be undertaking our first visit as soon as conditions really allow that to happen, which I think will be in February or early March.But what I think we will find is that there will be an equivalent vernacular tradition in Haiti from which we can learn a lot.I\'m sure the problem that we saw in Pakistan is shared in Haiti -- in that concrete buildings have been built poorly, without adequate technical supervision, and have proved very vulnerable to the earthquake.A good architect will never decide at a distance what the right technical approach would be, because it\'s always important to understand the location....So when we go to Haiti, the first thing we will do will be to carry out participation workshops with the local communities, to carry out a needs assessment but also a skills assessment... so we design the right buildings, appropriate to the materials available and the skills that are present.CNN : It\'s still early, but how do you assess the need in Haiti compared to the need in Pakistan ?Cross : All of the information we have at the moment suggests that the need is even greater in Haiti.In Pakistan, the earthquake did enormous damage, but there was still a strong national government, relatively strong local government and a strong military presence in the Pakistan army with which we could collaborate.In Haiti those institutions were already weak and in many cases have been destroyed by the earthquake.The partnerships which we would look to build with local governments may be much harder....There\'s likely to be an even greater role for strong strategic planning and long-term thinking from architects....I should say that you should never see Haiti as a blank slate.You look at the images, you think the damage is so great, it\'s a clean sweep -- but you should never see it as a blank canvas on which to impose a master plan from London or North America.There remains in Haiti a social infrastructure, an economic infrastructure, even in the slum areas there\'s an economically vibrant infrastructure.It\'s those threads of the community infrastructure that we need to find and build a new Haiti around.So all of our work starts with community participation and is part of empowering the local community and making sure that what we design is compatible with their objectives....One of the big problems immediately after this kind of disaster is the lack of long-term investment.The funding for short-term relief is good and is needed, but very often at the point of about a year, that funding just falls off a cliff.That\'s what I\'m hoping will be improved on in the Haiti response.', <re.Match object;

"Cross spoke to CNN on January 29.CNN : What is the role of architects in planning the rebuilding of Haiti, based on your experience in Pakistan ?Robin Cross : At this point, the focus is rightly on relief, and the provision of water, food and medical care, the basic life support system....What we wo n\'t be doing is clogging up that quite strained delivery system with the bricks and mortar of longer-term reconstruction.But there is going to come a point very shortly when minds need to turn to longer-term construction planning, and that\'s where architects and engineers have a role to play.Our work in Pakistan began quite soon after the earthquake.But the important factor is that it\'s still ongoing, that we need to be there for the long run....What we were doing there was working with local NGOs [ non-governmental organizations ], particularly with Muslim Aid, to identify the most vulnerable members of the community who could most benefit from our architectural and design skills, and could n\'t afford to buy in their own construction expertise, and would be most marginalized and vulnerable in the future.So we worked with Muslim Aid to develop a series of earthquake-resistant buildings which could then be delivered on a range of different sites.We put people in the field to provide quality assurance, to make sure that the buildings that were built would be earthquake-resistant.After a disaster there\'s an enormous demand for reconstruction, a demand for materials, designers, particularly builders -- so they will tend to be drawn very rapidly into high-value commercial work, which could leave less financially strong people without access to building skills.That could lead to them building in a poor and unsafe way, so you get into a very dangerous cycle of vulnerability.By building the capacity of local work teams to build, you enable people to build for themselves and break that cycle of vulnerability.CNN : What kind of buildings did you build ?Cross : We were intent on providing an earthquake-resistant home design....The buildings are a lightweight frame construction, which means they are able to flex in the event of an earthquake.We adopted the dhaji dewari technique, an indigenous technique developed out of the materials in that landscape.We adapted it and improved its details to make it more earthquake-resistant....CNN : How much do these houses cost ?Cross : Approximately &#163; 4,000 [ about $6,300 at current rates ] per house.That compares very well with the equivalent house in concrete block, which would normally be used.It is n\'t just safer than a concrete-block equivalent but it\'s also more economical and it\'s quicker to deliver.CNN : What\'s it made of ?Cross : It\'s made of lightweight timber frame with many cross-facing elements, and the gaps between cross-facing elements are infilled with stones and mud and then rendered over with mud.What that generates is a design which flexes when the earthquake strikes, the energy of the earthquake is dissipated through the many framing elements of the building, and the energy is lost in the friction between the timber and the stone infill....A concrete-block building which is n\'t able to flex is more apt to collapse....The other thing that\'s worth mentioning is that the buildings have a lightweight roof.In the worst eventuality, if the roof collapses, if it\'s lightweight, it\'s much less likely to kill people....CNN : What similarities are there between the building styles in Pakistan and Haiti ?Cross : I have n\'t yet been to Haiti, and we\'ll be undertaking our first visit as soon as conditions really allow that to happen, which I think will be in February or early March.But what I think we will find is that there will be an equivalent vernacular tradition in Haiti from which we can learn a lot.I\'m sure the problem that we saw in Pakistan is shared in Haiti -- in that concrete buildings have been built poorly, without adequate technical supervision, and have proved very vulnerable to the earthquake.A good architect will never decide at a distance what the right technical approach would be, because it\'s always important to understand the location....So when we go to Haiti, the first thing we will do will be to carry out participation workshops with the local communities, to carry out a needs assessment but also a skills assessment... so we design the right buildings, appropriate to the materials available and the skills that are present.CNN : It\'s still early, but how do you assess the need in Haiti compared to the need in Pakistan ?Cross : All of the information we have at the moment suggests that the need is even greater in Haiti.In Pakistan, the earthquake did enormous damage, but there was still a strong national government, relatively strong local government and a strong military presence in the Pakistan army with which we could collaborate.In Haiti those institutions were already weak and in many cases have been destroyed by the earthquake.The partnerships which we would look to build with local governments may be much harder....There\'s likely to be an even greater role for strong strategic planning and long-term thinking from architects....I should say that you should never see Haiti as a blank slate.You look at the images, you think the damage is so great, it\'s a clean sweep -- but you should never see it as a blank canvas on which to impose a master plan from London or North America.There remains in Haiti a social infrastructure, an economic infrastructure, even in the slum areas there\'s an economically vibrant infrastructure.It\'s those threads of the community infrastructure that we need to find and build a new Haiti around.So all of our work starts with community participation and is part of empowering the local community and making sure that what we design is compatible with their objectives....One of the big problems immediately after this kind of disaster is the lack of long-term investment.The funding for short-term relief is good and is needed, but very often at the point of about a year, that funding just falls off a cliff.That\'s what I\'m hoping will be improved on in the Haiti response.', <re.Match object;

There\'s no trace of them and their mothers and families of these girls -- they have n\'t got a clue what\'s happened to them. "Maria described how at the age of 16 she was lured off the streets by a young man who promised the world, but delivered nothing but pain.She was raped, drugged and sold for sex." They took a gallon of gasoline and started pouring it over a girl, " Maria said." One of the men told me if you do n\'t do as I say I will do the same to you." I wanted to look away, but they did n\'t let me.Even though the girl was on fire they kept hitting her and they were laughing as if they were enjoying what they were doing. "Maria described a cross-border trade in young children and babies -- with orders coming in regularly from the U.S." They stole the children and one of the gang members took a six-year-old kid that I had to look after for three hours." He told me he wanted to see his mummy then I started crying and said\'I do n\'t think you\'re ever going to see your mummy again.\' "The claims that Maria made were so serious that she was asked by the Department of Homeland Security to come to the U.S. to tell her story.Mexican authorities accompanied Maria on her trip to Houston to work alongside U.S. authorities on the case.The U.S. State Department estimates that more than 20,000 people are trafficked into the U.S. each year -- mainly destined for the sex trade.Authorities have launched an immediate investigation into Maria\'s story." I want to tell the story so that in the near future, other girls do n\'t go through the same, " Maria said." Women are sold, they are abducted, bought and even killed by these men." If these men are ever found, jail wo n\'t be enough to make them pay for the way they\'ve made us feel.

Toofan 5 is one of the most advanced missiles.It has two warheads which can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles, " Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi told Fars.The Qaem is a " missile which can destroy targets in the air traveling at low speed and at low altitude, especially assault helicopters, " Vahidi added.The laser guided anti-helicopter Qaem rocket is designed to resist enemy actions in electronic warfare.Iran is embroiled in a dispute with the West over its nuclear program and often makes announcements of progress in its military capabilities.The West suspects Iran of trying to build nuclear bombs, but Iran says its program is for peaceful power generation.On Friday, Iran\'s foreign minister said he believes a solution will be reached over a proposed deal to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations that worry that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons." The amount of uranium [ for export ] is negotiable.But I am confident that a solution can be found, " Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Iran\'s state-run Press TV reported.Earlier this week, Iran\'s atomic energy chief said no deal had been struck to export uranium for enrichment." The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements, " said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, on Wednesday according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency.Asked what countries in addition to France and Brazil were under consideration, he said it was an Asian country but would not name it.Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has told Press TV that Iran would have " no problem " turning over most of its low-enriched uranium to the West for further enrichment.Iranian diplomats had initially accepted the idea, which was proposed by the West, but then rejected a plan put forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the atomic watchdog of the United Nations." In our opinion, there are no issues with the exchange " of 3 percent to 5 percent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched uranium, Ahmadinejad said.He added that, if the West were to refuse to return the enriched fuel, world opinion would shift." If they do n\'t live up to their agreement, the international atmosphere will change in our favor, " he said." They [ Western countries ] can come and build 20 nuclear power plants for us ; Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts and build the power plants.It serves our interests as well as theirs.Of course if they do n\'t come to do this, we will reach a point to build our own power plants. "Mottaki on Friday said Ahmadinejad\'s comments show that the Islamic republic is " eager " to discuss the proposal.Iran insists its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes.', <re.Match object; span=(702, 707), match=' mark'>, '2010.02.06.iran.nuclear', '2010.02.06.iran.nuclear.tml']
['President Obama recently encouraged Americans to " take about 10 minutes to answer 10 questions " and fill out their 2010 census form.This year\'s questionnaire is one of the shortest in history, but the results of the survey have long-term effects.The census, taken every 10 years, is used to determine how to allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds and seats House of Representatives and determine the boundaries of representatives\' districts." There is no representative democracy without it.It\'s the scientific, nonpartisan, apolitical starting point of what eventually becomes a quite partisan, political process, " said Kenneth Prewitt, a professor at Columbia\'s School of International and Public Affairs and the former director of the United States Census Bureau.The House is made up of 435 congressional seats that represent relatively equal slices of the population.When data from the census show a shift in population, seats in the House get reassigned.Some states might pick up a seat or two, while others are forced to combine two districts into one.The process of apportioning seats is straightforward, but redistricting is much more complicated.Districts are supposed to be redrawn to reflect population changes and to make sure there is equal representation in the House.State legislators and governors typically draw the districts, but some states rely on restricting committees.Districts can affect the balance of power in the House and representation in the state legislature." People try to do things that are to their political advantage if they happen to be in power because maybe the next time the census comes out, the other party will be in power, " said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.Lawmakers have been accused of carving district lines around the constituents that will give their party an advantage and secure political gains.The process is known as gerrymandering, a term coined after Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry.Elected in 1810, he signed an obscure redistricting bill that enabled greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature.Related : Who was Elbridge Gerry ?Critics say gerrymandering gives those in power an unfair advantage and can dilute the power of minority groups.The Supreme Court in 2006 took up a case looking at a redistricting plan promoted by then-U.S.House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas.After the 2000 census, a state court redrew the Texas map with input from state lawmakers.But after Republicans gained control of the legislature in 2002, DeLay promoted a second redistricting proposal for congressional boundaries.The Texas legislature adopted the plan in 2003 after three contentious special sessions called by Republican Gov. Rick Perry.The legislative plan led to the 2004 ouster of four Democratic incumbents from Congress and sparked a bitter partisan battle.The court ruled that the redistricting plan unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts and tossed out a portion of the congressional map, but found the overall redistricting plan engineered by state Republicans acceptable.Prewitt said the redrawing of lines to the benefit of one party or the neglect of other is just a part of the political process." The production of the statistics has got to be nonpolitical... but the use of the statistics can be as political as the country wants it to be, " he said." I expect people to try to take advantage of situations to advance their political goals, interests, values -- so it\'s healthy.Now, do I think overtime creating districts so incumbents are always re-elected is the healthiest way to have a democracy ?No, " Prewitt said, adding that it\'s up to the voters to decide whether they want to throw someone out of office.The more pressing issue for Prewitt is making sure everyone is counted because he said those who are n\'t counted will be treated unfairly in the political process and in the allocation of economic benefits.With more than 300 million people in the United States, it can be difficult to make sure than everyone is counted.Frey said calculating the homeless population and the population of those who do not speak English can be particularly challenging.Illegal immigrants, for example, sometimes opt not to turn in census forms for fear of legal ramifications.Those fears, however, are unwarranted because the information is confidential." The challenge that they have is a cost challenge, " said Frey.The Census Bureau has to follow up with those who do n\'t send in their forms with additional forms, telephone calls and even in-person visits -- and that adds up, he said.This year\'s census is projected to cost more than $14 billion.Prewitt said it\'s comparatively easy to count the first 75 to 85 percent, but the last 2 to 3 percent is " really, really tough going. "As the census gets underway, Prewitt said trying to count everyone, as mandated by the Constitution, should be the top concern."

Proscription is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism and is not a course we take lightly, " Johnson said in a statement.Al-Muhajiroun is already banned under two other names in the Terrorism Act 2000 -- Al-Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.Johnson said the ban would now also apply to " a number " of the other names the group goes by.The proscription does not need approval by Parliament, because it is considered an amendment to the act, said the Home Office spokeswoman, who did not give her name in line with policy." We are clear that an organization should not be able to circumvent proscription by simply changing its name, " Johnson said.The ban would prevent Al-Muhajiroun from having meetings or raising money, and it would make attending a meeting or being a member of the group a crime.The group\'s leader, controversial British Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary, had threatened to stage a march in the town of Wootton Bassett as a protest against the war in Afghanistan.Choudary said Sunday, after news of Johnson\'s plans, that the Home Office could not shut him down." We\'re not going to stop because the government bans an organization, " he told CNN by phone." If that means setting up another platform under another label, then so be it. "A ban " will just make the use of those names... illegal.But Muslims everywhere are obliged to work collectively to establish the Islamic state and sharia law in the UK or wherever they are -- those things ca n\'t change, " he added.The bodies of British war dead are traditionally brought to Wootton Bassett, near a Royal Air Force base, when they are returned to the country.Relatives and friends line the streets of the town along with local residents as hearses carry the flag-draped British remains, in scenes of public mourning widely reported by British media.Choudary\'s proposal to march empty coffins through the streets drew fury and outrage.The Home Office had said the march would be illegal if the group were banned, but the decision to proscribe the group was not caused only by its plans for the march, the Home Office said.Choudary has never announced a date for his march and area police said he had not contacted them about it, as march organizers are required to do beforehand.The Terrorism Act 2000 gives the home secretary the power to ban groups if the punishment is " proportionate and based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000, " according to the Home Office.According to the law, groups can be banned if they commit or participate in terrorism ; prepare for terrorism ; or promote or encourage terrorism.The home secretary can also take into account factors such as specific threats posed to the United Kingdom or British nationals overseas, and the extent of the group\'s presence in the United Kingdom.', <re.Match object; span=(28, 33), match=' plan'>, '2010.01.12.uk.islamist.group.ban', '2010.01.12.uk.islamist.group.ban.tml']

['A French police officer has died in a shootout with suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA near Paris, the Spanish Interior Ministry said Wednesday.It is the first time a French police officer has been killed by ETA, a ministry spokeswoman added.ETA is blamed for more than 800 killings in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States.French police responded to reports of car theft in a town near Paris late Tuesday and a shootout ensued with a group of alleged thieves.Most of them escaped but police captured one and he was later identified as a suspected ETA member, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified.Spanish media reported that the shootout occurred in the town of Dammarie-les-Lys.The dead French policeman was wearing a bullet-proof vest but bullets struck fatally elsewhere on his body.He was reported to be in his 50s, and the father of four children.ETA has traditionally used France as its rearguard logistics and planning base to prepare attacks across the border in Spain, officials say.But in recent years as Spain has enlisted increased cooperation from France in cracking down on ETA hideouts, there have been various exchanges of gunfire between ETA suspects and French police, wounding some officers.Almost all of ETA\'s fatal shootings and car bombings have occurred in Spain.But in December 2007, ETA shot dead two Spanish Civil Guards in France.The officers were there on a joint undercover mission with France against ETA.Last February 28 in France, police arrested the suspected top ETA leader.At the time, French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told CNN affiliate BFM-TV, " France has long been considered as a logistical base for ETA.We have established a close cooperation with Spanish authorities, and we decided to strike, and strike hard because France does n\'t have to welcome terrorists.

['A French police officer has died in a shootout with suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA near Paris, the Spanish Interior Ministry said Wednesday.It is the first time a French police officer has been killed by ETA, a ministry spokeswoman added.ETA is blamed for more than 800 killings in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States.French police responded to reports of car theft in a town near Paris late Tuesday and a shootout ensued with a group of alleged thieves.Most of them escaped but police captured one and he was later identified as a suspected ETA member, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified.Spanish media reported that the shootout occurred in the town of Dammarie-les-Lys.The dead French policeman was wearing a bullet-proof vest but bullets struck fatally elsewhere on his body.He was reported to be in his 50s, and the father of four children.ETA has traditionally used France as its rearguard logistics and planning base to prepare attacks across the border in Spain, officials say.But in recent years as Spain has enlisted increased cooperation from France in cracking down on ETA hideouts, there have been various exchanges of gunfire between ETA suspects and French police, wounding some officers.Almost all of ETA\'s fatal shootings and car bombings have occurred in Spain.But in December 2007, ETA shot dead two Spanish Civil Guards in France.The officers were there on a joint undercover mission with France against ETA.Last February 28 in France, police arrested the suspected top ETA leader.At the time, French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux told CNN affiliate BFM-TV, " France has long been considered as a logistical base for ETA.We have established a close cooperation with Spanish authorities, and we decided to strike, and strike hard because France does n\'t have to welcome terrorists. "It was the fifth time since May 2008 that the suspected top ETA " military " leader, who directs commandos that carry out deadly attacks, has been detained, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on February 28.After each such arrest, ETA replaced the top leader, Rubalcaba said, and he warned that the latest arrests do not signify the end of ETA."

['Conservationists have welcomed the decision to reject a bid from Tanzania and Zambia to temporarily suspend a worldwide ban on trading in African elephant ivory so they can offload legal stockpiles in a one-off sale.The 175-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ), meeting in Doha, Qatar, on Monday, voted to reject the proposal amid concerns about elephant poaching.A petition from the two African countries to remove elephants from a list of animals " threatened with extinction " to allow trade in other parts of the animal was also thrown out." Poaching and illegal ivory markets in central and western Africa must be effectively suppressed before any further ivory sales take place, " said Elisabeth McLellan, of the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF )." It\'s welcome news, but my anxieties remain about the increased levels of poaching in Africa, " Save the Elephant\'s Dr. Ian Douglas-Hamilton told CNN.He said burgeoning ivory markets in countries such as China and Japan would be key battlegrounds in the fight against the illegal trade in future." There are huge problems ahead for the elephants, " he said." I do see this huge demand which is emanating mainly from the prosperity of China.We have to win their hearts and minds for conservation and for the elephant so that they have more of an idea of sustainable use and not over-taxing populations. "CITES banned the international commercial ivory trade in 1989 after elephant populations dropped dramatically across the world due to widespread poaching.But in 1997 and 2002 it permitted Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to sell limited stocks of ivory to Japan, in recognition of the fact that some southern African elephant populations were healthy and well managed.Five years later at a CITES meeting at The Hague further sales of stockpiled ivory were permitted in return for a nine-year moratorium on further sales.Both Zambia and Tanzania claimed elephant numbers in their territories were on the rise after years of decline.They also said the proceeds from the sale of government stockpiles would be put back into conservation and enforcement projects.Tanzania had asked to sell almost 90,000 kilograms of ivory that would have generated as much as $20 million, according to the CITES Web site, while Zambia looked to offload more than 21,000 kilograms.But wildlife experts in Kenya, part of a coalition of 23 African elephant range countries calling for an outright ban, say poaching has increased since the announcement of the last sale.Kenya orphanage takes elephant babies They argued the illegal trade in ivory has been turned into a lucrative business since poachers can launder their illegal ivory with the legal stockpiles." Though Zambia\'s anti-poaching enforcement measures are better than those of Tanzania, there is no justification for downgrading the elephants from the endangered list, " said Douglas-Hamilton, an expert on Kenya\'s elephant population." Tanzania has increased poaching and increased illegal markets.Their main elephant population has decreased by some 30,000 in the last three years." In Zambia there were huge declines in the elephant population in the 1970s and 1980s.Whereas other elephant populations across Africa have recovered slightly since the introduction of the ivory trade ban, Zambia\'s never have.They remain the same."

['Conservationists have welcomed the decision to reject a bid from Tanzania and Zambia to temporarily suspend a worldwide ban on trading in African elephant ivory so they can offload legal stockpiles in a one-off sale.The 175-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ), meeting in Doha, Qatar, on Monday, voted to reject the proposal amid concerns about elephant poaching.A petition from the two African countries to remove elephants from a list of animals " threatened with extinction " to allow trade in other parts of the animal was also thrown out."

"CITES banned the international commercial ivory trade in 1989 after elephant populations dropped dramatically across the world due to widespread poaching.But in 1997 and 2002 it permitted Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to sell limited stocks of ivory to Japan, in recognition of the fact that some southern African elephant populations were healthy and well managed.Five years later at a CITES meeting at The Hague further sales of stockpiled ivory were permitted in return for a nine-year moratorium on further sales.Both Zambia and Tanzania claimed elephant numbers in their territories were on the rise after years of decline.They also said the proceeds from the sale of government stockpiles would be put back into conservation and enforcement projects.Tanzania had asked to sell almost 90,000 kilograms of ivory that would have generated as much as $20 million, according to the CITES Web site, while Zambia looked to offload more than 21,000 kilograms.But wildlife experts in Kenya, part of a coalition of 23 African elephant range countries calling for an outright ban, say poaching has increased since the announcement of the last sale.Kenya orphanage takes elephant babies They argued the illegal trade in ivory has been turned into a lucrative business since poachers can launder their illegal ivory with the legal stockpiles." Though Zambia\'s anti-poaching enforcement measures are better than those of Tanzania, there is no justification for downgrading the elephants from the endangered list, " said Douglas-Hamilton, an expert on Kenya\'s elephant population."

['Sherlock Holmes the movie has already made more than $300 million at the box office worldwide and British tourism officials are hoping it means money for them too.Britain\'s tourism board has been promoting films for the past 15 years, so they know just how lucrative a movie like " Sherlock Homes " can be." To give you an example of a typical blockbuster film, it is normally seen by about 120 million people in the first three weeks of opening, " Visit Britain official Laurence Bresh told CNN." Even if a small percentage of those come to visit Britain as a result of this particular film, that\'s going to have a huge boost in some of those tourism attractions featured in our promotion. "As much of " Sherlock Holmes " is set in London this means big business for museum officials and gift shop operators.The Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221b Baker Street is the address where the fictional detective lived, according to the stories by Conan Doyle.Nearby, a nine-foot statue of Holmes greets visitors at the Baker Street Underground station.Inside the museum, visitors can check out Holmes\' study, sit in his armchair by the fireside, examine his calabash pipe and observe his chemistry equipment." I think Hollywood has put its magic touch on the legend, and they\'ve put, as it were, a magnifying glass over the character and of course things you could say are slightly exaggerated, but that\'s the wont of Hollywood and that\'s what makes these blockbusters successful, " John Riley, Assistant Curator of the Sherlock Holmes Museum said." So any new perspective, any new angle always just helps to perpetuate the legend of Sherlock Holmes.And that indirectly will obviously benefit the museum. "About 70,000 visitors a year stop by the Victorian lodging house, though officials are expecting a spike of interest fueled by the new movie.While thousands of tourists flock to visit the museum, many of its visitors are unaware that Sherlock Holmes was actually not real person." A few people do think he is a real character, particularly with the tour of his house on\'Baker Street\' adding fuel to the fire so to speak, " Mark Di-Toro from Visit Britain said." That is just testament to Doyle\'s brilliant writing with his true to nature locations in the books meaning tourist can really relate and visit all the fantastic locations. "A.
