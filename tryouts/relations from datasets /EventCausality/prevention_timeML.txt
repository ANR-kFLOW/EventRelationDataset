"Alabama issued a warning to drivers Thursday night, urging them to stay off icy roads as driving conditions were " becoming dangerous " with numerous accidents reported.Trooper Curtis Summerville with the Alabama State Patrol said the biggest problem on the roads was black ice on overpasses and bridges.But, he said football was helping keep people at home as University of Alabama fans cheered on their team in the National Championship Game against the University of Texas.A wind chill advisory was in effect until Friday in Arkansas, where readings were expected to drop below zero with winds of over 30 mph.A dusting of snow in Atlanta on Thursday night left roads slick after two weeks of below normal temperatures.CNN meteorologist Chad Myers noted that it was warmer in Fairbanks, Alaska, than it was in Atlanta on Thursday morning, calling the cold front sweeping the nation one that " we probably have n\'t seen for 15 years." 29-car pileup near Atlanta airport In the Deep South, Florida was under a state of emergency because of the threat to the state\'s lucrative citrus and vegetable industries.Gov.

['Mir Hossein Moussavi, the reformist Iranian politician who failed to unseat President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June election, raged Friday against government efforts to stifle protesters.Moussavi had addressed anti-government demonstrations Sunday in which at least seven protesters were killed, and warned that reformist sentiments wo n\'t disappear despite government attempts to silence them.The Iranian government denies that any of the deaths were caused by official security forces, but the clashes -- depicted in sometimes grainy and shaky amateur videos that show a number of protesters with serious and possibly fatal injuries, including some with apparent gunshot wounds -- appear to tell a different story.In one video -- shot Sunday, according to the posting on the Web site YouTube -- green-and-white police trucks speed into crowds of demonstrators in Tehran.Most of the protesters attempt to scatter, but one truck drives into a group trapped in a narrow street.As the truck backs away, one person can be seen crumpled in the street where it had been.When the camera returns to the spot, another truck drives over the person, whose fate is unclear.CNN cannot independently verify the validity of the videos.Friday\'s statement from Moussavi, posted on his Kaleme.org Web site, was the first since Sunday, when his nephew was killed in protests.The protests -- on the Shiite Muslim holy day Ashura -- were the deadliest since opposition Iranians took to the streets after the disputed June 12 presidential election.At least eight people were killed during those protests." Yours truly and friends are still being told that\'If you do n\'t issue announcements, the people will not take to the streets and will stop demonstrating, making the return of calm and stability possible throughout the country,\' " Moussavi said." I do not agree with these opinions, and I think that until such time that the needed reforms... can be extricated from the constitution... what has been lost will not be restored, " he added." I have no fear of being one of the martyrs that the people of this nation have offered, on the path of reaching their religious and national rights, and my blood will not be any redder than the blood of the other martyrs, " Moussavi said." Until a crisis is recognized as such, there will be no way to resolve it. "Moussavi seeks changes in election laws to make the voting process more transparent, the release of all political prisoners, freedom of the press and for the government to recognize " the legitimate right of the people to congregate legally. "Ayatollah Resaei, a conservative member of Iran\'s parliament, told state-run media Friday that Moussavi had shown in his comments that he accepted responsibility for the violence last Sunday." When he maintains that\'even if I do n\'t issue a statement, the people will take to the streets regardless,\' this shows that even before Ashura, those people took to the streets based on his statements." Moussavi has thereby accepted that he has issued statements even before this, based on which people took to the streets.On Ashura, he did not issue a statement, and they took to the streets anyway !Moussavi has thereby accepted full responsibility, " Resaei said in a statement.Resaei, former commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, accused Moussavi and reformist politicians Mohammad Khatami and Mehdi Karrubi of doing the bidding of enemies of Iran, and are therefore " domestic pawns " of foreigners.He named no nations." So if the authorities do not adhere to their duties [ to arrest and prosecute them ], the revolutionary people [ of Iran ] will execute the will of the Imam [ Khomeini ] to the fullest, " Resaei said, referring to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Republic of Iran in 1979.', 'stop ', '2010.01.01.iran.moussavi.tml']
['Tensions between Israel and Turkey spilled into a second day Tuesday when Turkish officials summoned the Israeli ambassador to a meeting, Turkey\'s Anatolia news agency reported.Israel criticized Turkey Monday for a Turkish television series that it said depicted Israeli intelligence agents as baby-snatchers.When asked about Tuesday\'s meeting between Israeli Ambassador Gabby Levy and Turkish officials, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said it was pre-planned.That session came one day after Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon summoned the Turkish ambassador to complain about the television show that Israel found offensive, a spokesman for Ayalon said.Afterward, Ayalon tweeted that he had " Told Turk Amb that this is an intolerable situation which endangers the Jewish community, the Israel envoys and tourists coming to Turkey. "Several senior Israeli Foreign Ministry sources, who did n\'t want to be named because it would jeopardize their jobs, criticized Ayalon\'s treatment of Turkish Ambassador Ahmet Oguz Celikkol at the start of their meeting Monday.At the session, Celikkol was seated below Ayalon.With cameras rolling, Ayalon turned to the television crews and said, " The main thing is that you see that he is seated low and that we are high... that there is one flag on the table ( the Israeli flag ) and that we are not smiling. "The sources told CNN they were " surprised by Ayalon\'s undiplomatic behavior. "Ceylon Ozen, spokeswoman for the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv, told CNN that Celikkol felt his treatment was " unacceptable, shocking and primitive, " and did not comply with standards for diplomacy.He has contacted the Israeli ambassador to Turkey and requested a formal apology from the Israelis, she said.There had been media speculation that Ayalon\'s summons was designed to sabotage a trip to Ankara Sunday by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak.A spokesman for Ayalon said that was " completely wide of the mark. "Barak\'s office said he had no plans to cancel his trip.Israeli politicians and media outlets roundly condemned an episode of the popular Turkish soap opera, " Valley of the Wolves : Ambush, " that depicted the Israeli intelligence service Mossad spying inside Turkey and kidnapping Turkish babies.The program also showed Mossad attacking the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv and taking the ambassador and his family hostage.In a written statement, " Valley of the Wolves : Ambush " producer Pana Film said the show " will continue to tell the truth and expose the wrongs. "Israel summoned the Turkish ambassador the same day that Turkey\'s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan lambasted Israel for air strikes Sunday on Gaza, the Turkish state-run Anatolian News Agency reported." Why is it doing this ?Because it says\'I possess the power in this region,\' " the news agency quoted Erdogan as saying of Israel." It possesses unproportionate power and it is using this.It is not acting in accordance with U.N. resolutions, it is uncomfortable.It says\'I will do whatever I please.\' "During a joint news conference, held with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Erdogan called for the international community " to warn Israel about its nuclear arsenal just like it did with Iran, " ANA reported.Israel is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal, but has never acknowledged that publicly.In a written statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the criticism." Erdogan\'s remarks join the anti-Israel program broadcast on Turkish television and the harsh statements against Israel that have been said consistently and systematically for over a year, " the statement said." The state of Israel reserves the full right to protect its citizens from missile attacks and from the terror of the Hamas and Hezbollah.Turkey is the last that can preach morality to Israel and the IDF ( Israel Defense Forces ). "" Valley of the Wolves : Ambush " is part of a popular franchise in Turkey.The series " Valley of the Wolves " first aired in 2003 on Turkish television, followed by a 2006 movie of the same name that stirred controversy with its portrayal of American soldiers in Iraq and what some described as thinly-veiled anti-Semitism.The movie, based on the series, featured American actors Gary Busey and Billy Zane.Another television version, " Valley of the Wolves : Terror, " was canceled after one episode in February 2007." Ambush " first aired in April 2007.Israel and Turkey have enjoyed close military and economic ties for more than a decade.But relations have grown testy at times in recent years over Israel\'s activities in the Palestinian territories and over its Gaza offensive in December and January.CNN\'s Kevin Flower and Shira Medding contributed to this report.', 'protect ', '2010.01.12.turkey.israel.tml']
['A controversial Muslim group planning to stage an anti-war march through a town that receives British war dead will be banned in the UK from Thursday.British Home Secretary Alan Johnson prepared an order Tuesday proscribing Al-Muhajiroun, also known as Islam4UK." Proscription is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism and is not a course we take lightly, " Johnson said in a statement.Al-Muhajiroun is already banned under two other names in the Terrorism Act 2000 -- Al-Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.Johnson said the ban would now also apply to " a number " of the other names the group goes by.The proscription does not need approval by Parliament, because it is considered an amendment to the act, said the Home Office spokeswoman, who did not give her name in line with policy." We are clear that an organization should not be able to circumvent proscription by simply changing its name, " Johnson said.The ban would prevent Al-Muhajiroun from having meetings or raising money, and it would make attending a meeting or being a member of the group a crime.The group\'s leader, controversial British Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary, had threatened to stage a march in the town of Wootton Bassett as a protest against the war in Afghanistan.Choudary said Sunday, after news of Johnson\'s plans, that the Home Office could not shut him down." We\'re not going to stop because the government bans an organization, " he told CNN by phone." If that means setting up another platform under another label, then so be it. "A ban " will just make the use of those names... illegal.But Muslims everywhere are obliged to work collectively to establish the Islamic state and sharia law in the UK or wherever they are -- those things ca n\'t change, " he added.The bodies of British war dead are traditionally brought to Wootton Bassett, near a Royal Air Force base, when they are returned to the country.Relatives and friends line the streets of the town along with local residents as hearses carry the flag-draped British remains, in scenes of public mourning widely reported by British media.Choudary\'s proposal to march empty coffins through the streets drew fury and outrage.The Home Office had said the march would be illegal if the group were banned, but the decision to proscribe the group was not caused only by its plans for the march, the Home Office said.Choudary has never announced a date for his march and area police said he had not contacted them about it, as march organizers are required to do beforehand.The Terrorism Act 2000 gives the home secretary the power to ban groups if the punishment is " proportionate and based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000, " according to the Home Office.According to the law, groups can be banned if they commit or participate in terrorism ; prepare for terrorism ; or promote or encourage terrorism.The home secretary can also take into account factors such as specific threats posed to the United Kingdom or British nationals overseas, and the extent of the group\'s presence in the United Kingdom.', 'prevent ', '2010.01.12.uk.islamist.group.ban.tml']

['Sherlock Holmes the movie has already made more than $300 million at the box office worldwide and British tourism officials are hoping it means money for them too.Britain\'s tourism board has been promoting films for the past 15 years, so they know just how lucrative a movie like " Sherlock Homes " can be." To give you an example of a typical blockbuster film, it is normally seen by about 120 million people in the first three weeks of opening, " Visit Britain official Laurence Bresh told CNN." Even if a small percentage of those come to visit Britain as a result of this particular film, that\'s going to have a huge boost in some of those tourism attractions featured in our promotion. "As much of " Sherlock Holmes " is set in London this means big business for museum officials and gift shop operators.The Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221b Baker Street is the address where the fictional detective lived, according to the stories by Conan Doyle.Nearby, a nine-foot statue of Holmes greets visitors at the Baker Street Underground station.Inside the museum, visitors can check out Holmes\' study, sit in his armchair by the fireside, examine his calabash pipe and observe his chemistry equipment." I think Hollywood has put its magic touch on the legend, and they\'ve put, as it were, a magnifying glass over the character and of course things you could say are slightly exaggerated, but that\'s the wont of Hollywood and that\'s what makes these blockbusters successful, " John Riley, Assistant Curator of the Sherlock Holmes Museum said." So any new perspective, any new angle always just helps to perpetuate the legend of Sherlock Holmes.And that indirectly will obviously benefit the museum. "About 70,000 visitors a year stop by the Victorian lodging house, though officials are expecting a spike of interest fueled by the new movie.While thousands of tourists flock to visit the museum, many of its visitors are unaware that Sherlock Holmes was actually not real person." A few people do think he is a real character, particularly with the tour of his house on\'Baker Street\' adding fuel to the fire so to speak, " Mark Di-Toro from Visit Britain said." That is just testament to Doyle\'s brilliant writing with his true to nature locations in the books meaning tourist can really relate and visit all the fantastic locations. "A.
